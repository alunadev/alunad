# Hi, I'm Adrian 👋

I’m an **Industrial Engineer turned Product Manager** with 10 years of experience creating, launching, and scaling digital products. I currently lead the Official Products portfolio at LALIGA, shaping the vision and prioritizing initiatives that enhance the fan experience for millions.

I am specialized in full ownership of the product lifecycle, from vision to scale, and my focus is on **measurable outcomes** with an **AI-first and data-driven approach** for making an impact on the business.

## What I work on

I leverage **AI agents** to automate core Product Management workflows (Discovery & Delivery), synthesizing research, analyzing user feedback, and generating documentation to accelerate the path to **measurable business impact**. 

## Tech Stack & Product Toolkit 🛠️

This is my refined core product toolkit. I constantly try and test new tools (AI, No-Code) to stay updated on emerging technology stacks and trends, ensuring my approach remains sharp and scalable.
